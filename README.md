# Stylus Dummy Project

This is merely a learning project after discovering ITCSS. I was heavily inspired by Harry Roberts's speech he did in 2014 and after just finding it out (I'm quite new to HTML and CSS in general) I wanted to begin learning it.

Feel free to clone this if you want to learn yourself or just study through the code. If you see anything methodically wrong in terms of the ITCSS structure please let me know. I'm always eager to learn from mistakes and improve.

I will add a themes layer afterwards, for now I'm focused on the basics.

## Technologies Used

- ITCSS Methodology
- Stylus Preprocessor

Major credit if not all credit obviously to [Harry Roberts](https://github.com/csswizardry) for inspiring me to do this and learn.
